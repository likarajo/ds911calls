~ Import numpy and pandas
~ Import visualization libraries

~ Read in the 911.csv file as a dataframe called df

~ Check the info() of the df

~ Check the head of df

~ What are the top 5 zipcodes for 911 calls?

~ What are the top 5 townships(twp) for 911 calls?

~ Take a look at the 'title' column, how many unique title codes are there?

~ In the titles column there are "Reasons/Departments" specified before the title code. 
These are EMS, Fire, and Traffic.
Use .apply() with a custom lambda expression to create a new column called "Reason" 
that contains this string value.
For example, if the title column value is EMS: BACK PAINS/INJURY, 
the Reason column value would be EMS.

~ What is the most common Reason for a 911 call based off of this new column?

~ Now use seaborn to create a countplot of 911 calls by Reason.

~Now let us begin to focus on time information. 
What is the data type of the objects in the timeStamp column?

~You should have seen that these timestamps are still strings. 
Use pd.to_datetime to convert the column from strings to DateTime objects.

~ You can now grab specific attributes from a Datetime object by calling them. 
For example:
time = df['timeStamp'].iloc[0]
time.hour

~ Notice how the Day of Week is an integer 0-6. 
Use the .map() with this dictionary to map the actual string
names to the day of the week:

~ Now use seaborn to create a countplot of the Day of Week column 
with the hue based off of the Reason column.
Now do the same for Month:

~ Now create a simple plot off of the dataframe indicating the count of calls per month.

~ Now see if you can use seaborn's lmplot() to create a linear fit on the number of calls
per month. Keep in mind you may need to reset the index to a column.

~ Create a new column called 'Date' that contains the date from the timeStamp column. 
You'll need to use apply along with the .date() method.

~ Now groupby this Date column with the count() aggregate and create a plot of 
counts of 911 calls.

~ Now recreate this plot but create 3 separate plots with each plot representing 
a Reason for the 911 call

~ We'll first need to restructure the dataframe so that the columns become the Hours and the Index becomes the Day of the Week.

~ Now create a HeatMap using this new DataFrame.

~ Now repeat these same plots and operations, for a DataFrame that shows the Month as the column.
